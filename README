Switch::Perlish version 1.0.5
=============================

This is a Perl-oriented implementation of the "switch" statement. It uses
smart-matching in "case"s which can be configured and extended by the user.
There is no magical syntax so "switch"/"case"/"default" expect coderefs,
which are most simply provided by anonymous subroutines. By default
successful "case" statements do not fall through[1]. To fall through a
"case" block call the "fallthrough" subroutine explicitly. For "C" style
"switch" behaviour[2] simply call the module with an upper-case C i.e

  use Switch::Perlish 'C';

[1] To 'fall through' in a "case" block means that the "switch" block
isn't exited upon success.

[2] upon a "case" succesfully matching all subsequent "case"s succeed;
to break out from the current "switch" completely use "stop".
