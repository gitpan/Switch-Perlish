Switch::Perlish version 1.0.4
=============================

This is a Perl-oriented implementation of the switch statement. It uses
smart-matching in cases which can be configured and extended by the user.
There is no magical syntax so switch/case/default expect coderefs,
which are most simply provided by anonymous subroutines. By default successful
case statements do not fall through[1]. To fall through a case block
call the fallthrough subroutine explicitly. For C style switch
behaviour[2] simply call the module with an upper-case C i.e

  use Switch::Perlish 'C';

[1] To 'fall through' in a case block means that the switch block
isn't exited upon success

[2] upon a case succesfully matching all subsequent cases succeed, to
break from the switch completely use end
