Switch::Perlish version 1.0.0
=============================

This is a Perl-oriented implementation of the C<switch> statement. It uses
smart-matching in C<case>s which can be configured and extended by the user.
There is no magical syntax so C<switch>/C<case>/C<default> expect coderefs,
which are most simply provided by anonymous subroutines. By default successful
C<case> statements do not fall through[1]. To get fall through functionality
call the C<fallthrough> function explicitly.

[1] To 'fall through' in a C<case> block means that the C<switch> block isn't
exited upon success
